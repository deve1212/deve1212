👋 Hi, I'm Devender Bhatt

Full-stack Developer | Ruby on Rails • React.js • JavaScript • Spring Boot

🚀 About Me

I love building clean, scalable, and performance-focused applications. My work spans across Ruby on Rails, React.js, JavaScript, Spring Boot, Liquid, and anything else that catches my curiosity.

I’m constantly learning, experimenting, and polishing my craft — whether it’s backend architecture, frontend UX, or dev tooling.

🔥 Tech I'm Into

Ruby on Rails — APIs, ActiveRecord, background jobs, scaling

React.js / JavaScript — UI/UX, component design, performance

Spring Boot (Java) — REST APIs, microservices, enterprise patterns

Liquid — Shopify / theme customizations

DevOps touches — Sidekiq, Redis, Postgres, Docker, CI/CD basics

🌱 Currently Exploring

System design

Concurrency & background job architectures

Clean code & design patterns across languages

Anything interesting in the full-stack or dev-tools space
